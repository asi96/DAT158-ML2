This is my hand in to machine learning project 2 in the course DAT158 as well as my submission to the Kaggle contest https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview


The machine learning model has been deployed and can be run locally by executing the following command in a python terminal:

`python housepriceapp.py`
